let's break down the code step by step:

HTML Structure:
The HTML defines the structure of the todo list app.
It includes elements like the input field for adding new tasks, buttons, filters for completed and pending tasks, and a container to display the todos.

CSS Styling: 
The CSS file (style.css) is responsible for styling the elements of the todo list app. 
It defines the appearance, layout, and behavior of various components such as input fields, buttons, todo items, and filters.

JavaScript Logic:
The JavaScript code (script.js) adds interactivity and functionality to the todo list app. 
It starts by selecting elements from the HTML document using document.querySelector() and document.querySelectorAll().
It initializes an array todosJson to store todo items. It retrieves saved todos from local storage or initializes an empty array if there are no saved todos. 
The showTodos() function renders todo items on the page based on the data stored in todosJson.
The getTodoHtml() function generates HTML markup for each todo item.

Event listeners are set up to handle user interactions:
Adding a new todo item when the enter key is pressed or the add button is clicked.
Updating the status of a todo item (completed/pending) when the checkbox is clicked.
Removing a todo item when the delete button is clicked. Filtering todo items based on their status (completed/pending) when filter buttons are clicked.
Deleting all todo items when the "Delete All" button is clicked. 
The state of todo items (completed or pending) is stored in the todosJson array and synced with local storage to persist data across page reloads.




Explanation: 
The todo list app allows users to add, update, and delete tasks. Tasks are displayed in a list format with checkboxes to mark them as completed. 
Users can also filter tasks based on their completion status.
The app uses local storage to store task data, ensuring that tasks are saved even after the page is refreshed or closed.
The styling ensures that the app has a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
Overall, the app provides a simple and effective way for users to manage their tasks and stay organized.
