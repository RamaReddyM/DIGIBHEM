This code creates a simple calculator with the functionality to switch between dark and light themes. Let's break it down step by step:

HTML Structure:
The HTML contains a container (div.container) with a calculator (div.calculator) inside.
The calculator includes a theme toggler (div.theme-toggler) and a display screen (div.display-screen) to show the calculations.
Buttons (button) for numbers, operators, clear, and equal sign are placed inside a table within the calculator.

CSS Styling:
CSS styles define the appearance of various elements, including the calculator layout, buttons, display screen, and theme toggler.
Dark and light themes are defined using different color schemes for backgrounds, text, and button colors.

JavaScript Logic:
JavaScript code handles the functionality of the calculator and theme toggler.
It selects the display element (#display) and all buttons on the calculator.
It attaches a click event listener to each button.
When a button is clicked, it checks its ID and performs different actions:
If the button is "clear", it clears the display.
If the button is "backspace", it removes the last character from the display.
If the display is not empty and the button is "equal", it evaluates the expression using eval() and displays the result.
If the display is empty and the button is "equal", it briefly displays "Empty!" and clears it after 2 seconds.
Otherwise, it appends the button's text to the display.
It selects the theme toggler button (div.theme-toggler) and the calculator (div.calculator).
When the theme toggler button is clicked, it toggles the "dark" class on the calculator, which switches between dark and light themes.
It also toggles the "active" class on the theme toggler button to indicate the current theme state.
The isDark variable keeps track of the current theme state.



End of Explanation:
This code creates a functional calculator with the ability to switch between dark and light themes. 
It demonstrates basic DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript, along with styling using CSS.
